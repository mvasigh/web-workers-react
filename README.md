# Web Workers and React
Welcome! 🎉 This is the companion repository for my talk on using the Web Workers API within your React application. 

## Requirements
* Git
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 10.x.x+
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

## Getting started
If you want to code along with the workshop portion of the talk, you will need to clone this repository on your machine. If you want to commit changes and play around with the code as much as you want, fork the repo and clone your fork instead--you may want to set this repo as your upstream so that you can pull any new changes.

To clone, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mvasigh/web-workers-react.git
cd web-workers-react 
```

### Repository structure
This repository consists of two applications: 
* ["Vanilla" JS Web Workers Example](vanilla-app)
* [React Web Workers Example](react-app)

### Installing dependencies
It is recommended that you install dependencies for each of these applications before the workshop in case there are difficulties with WiFi. Simply run `npm install` or `yarn` in each of the two directories to install any necessary depencencies:

```bash
cd vanilla-app
npm install

cd ../react-app
npm install
```
